**DESCRIPTION**

The aim of the project is to compare and evaluate the performance of various machine
learning models in classifying waveform generator. A multi-feature dataset of waveform
signals was considered. The compared models are Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and K-Nearest Neighbors.Performance was observed based on accuracy and precision measurements, confusion
matrices, and classification reports.
